Description of Services & Deliverables

CapTech shall provide the following Services:  
 

•  Milestone 1 (end of week 3): CapTech will deliver an initial SSIS package and accompanying data 
warehouse that addresses the needs for the “% Change” metrics and reporting needs, e.g., tracking 
the number of changes associated with shot distance readings per stroke.  CapTech will build this 
process in an automated fashion and will work with the Client to refine requirements for the end-
state system through the 3-week development phase. 

•  Milestone 2 (weeks 6-8): Using the data warehouse created in Milestone 1, CapTech will begin to 
address reporting and  data modeling needs for the  remaining metrics.  Through the remaining 
weeks, CapTech will work with the Client to prioritize all data and reporting needs and will begin to 
scale  the  existing  data  warehouse  to  accommodate  new  requests,  with  a  focus  on  developing 
maintainable underlying models.  

•  Project Reporting: CapTech will deliver a weekly status update along with the SOW financials 

(e.g., hours consumed, estimated $/hours remaining).
